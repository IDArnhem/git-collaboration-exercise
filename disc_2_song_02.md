yes i am lonely
wanna die
yes i am lonely
wanna die
if i am dead already
girl you know the reason why
in the morning, wanna die
in the evening, wanna die
if i aint dead already
girl you know the reason why
my mother was out the sky
my father was out the earth
i am form the universe
and you know what its worth
i am lonely
wanna die
if i aint dead already
girl you know the reason why
the evil bitch my eyes
the one who licks my bones
feel so suicidal
just like dinner
lonely
wanna die
if i aint dead already
girl you know the reason why
black cloud cross my mind
you miss right my sole
feel so suicidal
wanna die
wanna die
if i aint dead already
girl you know the reason why
wanna die
