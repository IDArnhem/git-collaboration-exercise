pling pling pling....
more pling
even more pling

Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
all day long I am singing songs for everyone

sit beside a mountain stream
sea her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

to to to toooodotodooo
to to to toddoodooooo
dooodooodooooo

find me in my field of grass
mother natures son swaying daisies singing lazy song beneath the sun

to to to toooodotodooo
to to to toddoodooooo
dooodooodooooo

mother nature's son
