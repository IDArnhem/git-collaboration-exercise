Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just touch Julia
Julia, Julia, ---- child, tells me

So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, something eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering

In the ---
Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
When I can sing to a heart
I can only speak -----, Julia
Julia, sleeping ----, -----, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Hum, hum, hum, ----
So I sing a song of love, Julia, Julia, Julia
