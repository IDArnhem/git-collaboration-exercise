She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the USA
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say...

Honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?

Oh honey pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your hollywood song

You became a legend if the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you makes me weak in he knees

Oh honey pie
You were driving me frantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie come back to me

Yeayea
I like it like that, oeha
I like this kinda hot music, hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me honeywood blue

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me
T-T-Tee, now

Honey pie
You ar emaking me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Come, come back to me

Honey pie, honey pie-ie-ie
Hmhmhmhmhm, oh oh
Ohohoh
Honey pie, honey pie
